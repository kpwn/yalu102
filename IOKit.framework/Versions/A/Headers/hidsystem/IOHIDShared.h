    SHARED MEMORY OVERVIEW
    
    PERSPECTIVE
    The ev driver and PostScript share at least one page of wired memory.
    This memory contains the low-level event queue which ev deposits events
    into and PostScript reads events from. Also, this memory contains other
    important data such as wait cursor state and some general cursor state.
    This memory is critical for speed.  That is, we avoid having to make
    system calls for common operations.
    
    SHARED MEMORY REGIONS
    There are currently three "regions" or "zones" delineated within this
    shared memory.  The first zone is the EvOffsets structure. This structure
    contains two offsets from the beginning of shared memory. The first offset
    is to the second zone, EvGlobals. The second offset is to the third
    zone, private shmem for drivers.
    
    INITIALIZATION OF SHARED MEMORY
    When the WindowServer starts up, it finds all screens that will be active.
    It then opens the ev driver and calls the EVIOSSCR ioctl repeatedly for
    each screen in use. This lets the ev driver set up the evScreen array
    and fill in each element. This ioctl also returns to PostScript a running
    total shared memory size with which to allocate. PostScript then allocates
    a region of memory this size and calls evmmap to "map in" this shared
    region.  Evmmap initializes and fills in the EvOffsets and EvGlobals.
    Next the WindowServer calls each screen in turn to register itself with
    the ev driver in the same sequence as presented to EVIOSSCR.  Each screen
    driver calls ev_register_screen() which among other things allocates a
    part of the private shmem (of the third shared memory zone) for the driver.
    
    DEBUGGING NOTES
    You can easily display and set this shared memory from kgdb, but usually
    cannot do so from within PostScript.  Gdb (or some weird interaction
    between gdb and the os) chokes on this shmem.  So if you read or write
    this area of memory, copy-on-write will occur and you'll get a completely
    new page for PostScript.  This will render the shared memory scheme
    useless and you will have to restart PostScript.  It was my understanding
    that before, we were able to "read" this area from PS, but not write to
    it (the idea behind copy-on-WRITE).  However, this seems to be broken
    in 2.0.  We think this is a kernel bug.
