    @abstract Abstract class that manages the connection between an IONetworkController and the data link interface layer.
    @discussion An IONetworkInterface object manages the connection between
    an IONetworkController and the data link interface layer (DLIL).
    All interactions between the controller and DLIL must go through an
    interface object. Any data structures that are required by DLIL for a
    particular interface type shall be allocated and mantained by the
    interface object. IONetworkInterface is an abstract class that must be
    extended by a concrete subclass to specialize for a particular network
    type.

    Although most drivers will allocate a single interface object,
    it is possible for multiple interfaces to be attached to a single
    controller. This controller driver will be responsible for arbitrating
    access among its multiple interface clients.
    
    IONetworkInterface also maintains a dictionary of IONetworkData
    objects containing statistics structures. Controller drivers can
    ask for a particular data object by name and update the
    statistics counters within directly. This dictionary is added to
    the interface's property table and is visible outside of the kernel.
