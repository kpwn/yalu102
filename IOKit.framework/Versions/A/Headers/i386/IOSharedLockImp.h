 *
 *
 * HISTORY
 * 29 April 1992    Mike Paquette at NeXT
 *      Created. 
 *
 * Multiprocessor locks used within the shared memory area between the
 * kernel and event system.  These must work in both user and kernel mode.
 * The locks are defined in an include file so they get exported to the local
 * include file area.
 *
 * This is basically a ripoff of the spin locks under the cthreads packages.
