Please use the "Issues" tab for **code related** issues only. If you need support please search on [/r/jailbreak](https://reddit.com/r/jailbreak) before posting a question there.

| iPhone SE  | iOS 10.0.0 -> iOS 10.2 |
| iPhone 5S  | iOS 10.0.0 -> iOS 10.2 |
| iPad Air| iOS 10.0.0 -> iOS 10.2 |
| iPad Mini 2| iOS 10.0.0 -> iOS 10.2 |

### Planned Support:

In the near future, the jailbreak will support the following devices:

| Device | Version |
|---------|----------|
| iPhone 7  | iOS 10.0.0 -> iOS 10.1.1 |

**Note, the iPhone 7 is only supported till iOS 10.1.1**
If you are already on iOS 10.2 with an iPhone 7, **stay there**. The actual exploit behind this still works, but the KPP bypass does not.

## Compiling:

1. `git clone` the repo.
2. Open the repo in Xcode
3. Change the bundle ID, as shown [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sideloaded/wiki/how-to-sideload#wiki_changing_the_bundle_identifier_and_team)
4. Run the project.

## Warnings

This jailbreak is a work in progress. Some things do not work, but most things do.

Do not install things that are untested.

**AppSync and other unsupported and untested software will probably throw your device into a bootloop or do other bad things.** Do not open an issue complaining that your device has been bootlooped because you installed other software. You have been warned.
